HealthChain is a decentralized healthcare data management platform that empowers patients to take full control of their health records while ensuring data privacy and security using blockchain technology. Built on NEAR Protocol, HealthChain enables patients to store, access, and share their health information with healthcare providers, researchers, and institutions seamlessly. 



Through blockchainâ€™s immutable and encrypted structure, HealthChain protects sensitive medical data from tampering or unauthorized access, giving patients peace of mind. Patients can monetize their health data by sharing anonymized information with researchers or pharmaceutical companies, incentivizing participation in medical advancements while maintaining privacy. The platform uses smart contracts to ensure that all data transactions, such as access by third parties, are transparent and based on patient consent.



Additionally, HealthChain aims to solve real-world issues like fragmented health data, lack of patient control, and data breaches. By promoting patient ownership and creating a global, interoperable healthcare data system, HealthChain facilitates more efficient and secure healthcare services. This helps to streamline patient care, reduce costs, and foster medical research, providing a sustainable and patient-centered solution in the healthcare sector.
